# WEB SOLUTION WITH WORDPRESS

In this project we will be preparing storage infrastructure on two Linux servers and implement a basic web solution using WordPress.

## Step 1 LAUNCH TWO EC2 INSTANCES THAT WILL SERVE AS “WEB SERVER” AND "DB SERVER" RESPECTIVELY.
For this project we would be launching `RHEL` instances to use for our setup

We would create 3 volumes in the same AZ as our EC2 Web Server, each of 10 Gb.

Then attach them to the web server instance

Open up the terminal for the web server and use the `lsblk` command to inspect what block devices are attached to the server

From the above image, we can see the newly created devices listed as `xvdf, xvdg, xvdh`

We would be using the gdisk utility to create a single partition on each of the 3 disks as shown in the image below - 

```
sudo gdisk /dev/xvdf
```

Use the `lsblk` utility to view the newly configured partitions on each of the 3 disks.

Install the `lvm2` package using `sudo yum install lvm2 -y` 

Run `sudo lvmdiskscan` command to check for available partitions.

Use `pvcreate` utility to mark each of 3 disks as physical volumes (PVs) to be used by LVM

```
sudo pvcreate /dev/xvdf1
sudo pvcreate /dev/xvdg1
sudo pvcreate /dev/xvdh1
```

We would verify that our Physical volume has been created successfully by running `sudo pvs`

Use the `vgcreate` utility to add all 3 PVs to a volume group (VG). Name the VG `webdata-vg`

```
sudo vgcreate webdata-vg /dev/xvdh1 /dev/xvdg1 /dev/xvdf1
```

Verify that the VG has been created successfully by running `sudo vgs`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22638955/135511290-fc844f49-6f1d-40f9-a8da-f6569a469271.png)

Use the `lvcreate` utility to create 2 logical volumes. apps-lv (Use half of the PV size), and logs-lv Use the remaining space of the PV size. Apps-lv will be used to store data for the Website while, logs-lv will be used to store data for logs.

```
sudo lvcreate -n apps-lv -L 14G webdata-vg
sudo lvcreate -n logs-lv -L 14G webdata-vg
```
Verify that the Logical Volumes have been created successfully by running `sudo lvs`

Verify the entire setup
```
sudo vgdisplay -v #view complete setup - VG, PV, and LV
sudo lsblk 
```

Use mkfs.ext4 to format the logical volumes with ext4 filesystem
```
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/webdata-vg/apps-lv
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/webdata-vg/logs-lv
```

Create `/var/www/html` directory to store website files
```
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html
```

Create `/home/recovery/logs` to store backup of log data
```
sudo mkdir -p /home/recovery/logs
```

Mount `/var/www/html` on `apps-lv` logical volume
```
sudo mount /dev/webdata-vg/apps-lv /var/www/html/
```

We would use the `rsync` utility to backup all the files in the log directory /var/log into /home/recovery/logs as this is required before mounting the file system
```
sudo rsync -av /var/log/. /home/recovery/logs/
```

Mount `/var/log` on `logs-lv` logical volume. (Note that all the existing data on `/var/log` will be deleted. That is why we backed up the `log` directory earlier
```
sudo mount /dev/webdata-vg/logs-lv /var/log
```

Restore `log` files back into `/var/log` directory
```
sudo rsync -av /home/recovery/logs/. /var/log
```

Update `/etc/fstab` file so that the mount configuration will persist after restart of the server.

The UUID of the device will be used to update the `/etc/fstab` file;

To get the UUID of the devices, we would run `sudo blkid`

Open up the `/etc/fstab` file using `sudo vi /etc/fstab` and paste the UUID's as shown in the image below

Test the configuration and reload the daemon
```
sudo mount -a
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Verify the setup by running df -h, output must look like what is below:
